# Personal Website

Hello! Thanks for checking out the repo for my latest portfolio website. This website isn't just my new portfolio, but also a personal project in and of itself. I think I've grown quite a bit as a developer & designer in the past year, so I wanted to create something to showcase some of what I've learned and done.
